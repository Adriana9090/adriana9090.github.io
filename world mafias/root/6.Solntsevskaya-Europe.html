    <p class="history">
        <span id="histo">History</span> The Solntsevskaya gang was founded in the late 1980s. Based in the Solntsevo District of Moscow, the gang recruited local unemployed, young men as foot soldiers and also made use of thief in law Dzhemal Khachidze
        to enhance their reputation amongst established criminals. The Solntsevo District was also strategically located near the M3 highway leading to Ukraine, the MKAD, Moscow's ring road, as well as the Vnukovo International Airport. Controlling these
        transport hubs allowed the Solntsevo group to muscle in on the car import business. But by the early 1990s, the Solntsevo's dominance was challenged by the Chechen mafia. In the 1990s, the Solntsevskaya dispatched Vyacheslav Ivankov to Brighton
        Beach, New York City, and Mikhail Odenussa to Atlanta, Georgia, to take control of the Russian mob activities there. The Solntsevskaya have also been active in Israel, primarily using it as a base for money laundering. By the end of the 1990s,
        the Solntsevskaya gang started moving into the banking sector, a move which enabled them to launder their money as well as get closer to the oligarchs. The organization is also involved in the international cocaine trade, with its links to Colombian
        drug cartels brokered by the Cuntrera-Caruana Mafia clan.
