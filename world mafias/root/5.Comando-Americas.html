    <p class="history">
        <span id="histo">History</span> The Comando Vermelho is Brazil’s oldest criminal group. It was created in 1969 when convicts and left-wing political prisoners were incarcerated together during the military dictatorship of 1964-1985. The organization
        is a collection of independent cells. By 1979, the group had spread out of the prison and into Rio’s streets. Members who were on the outside were tasked with providing money to those on the inside through criminal activities such as bank robbery,
        allowing them to maintain a decent quality of life in prison and to finance escape attempts. The ideas of the Comando Vermelho spread to other prisons, and the power of the organization grew. The group started out with low-level crimes like muggings
        and bank robberies, but in the 1980s the group moved into the cocaine trade, working with Colombian drug cartels and taking on a social leadership role in many of Rio’s marginalized neighborhoods. The Comando partnered with Colombian cartels when
        the cocaine trade began to boom in the 1980s, as it had the structure and organization to reliably obtain and distribute large quantities of the drug. It gained control of many poor neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro that had been neglected by the
        state, setting up a parallel system of government inside the favelas and providing employment to inhabitants long excluded from Brazilian society.
