    <p class="history">
        <span id="histo">History</span> A jihadist terrorist organization based in northeastern Nigeria, also active in Chad, Niger and northern Cameroon. Founded by Mohammed Yusuf in 2002, the group has been led by Abubakar Shekau since 2009. When Boko
        Haram first formed, their actions were nonviolent. Their main goal was to "purify Islam in northern Nigeria". Since March 2015, the group has been aligned with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.Since the current insurgency started in 2009,
        Boko Haram has killed tens of thousands and displaced 2.3 million from their homes and was at one time the world's deadliest terror group according to the Global Terrorism Index. Boko Haram was founded upon the principles of the Salafism advocating
        Sharia law. It developed into a Jihadist group in 2009. The movement is diffuse, and fighters associated with it follow the Salafi doctrine. Their beliefs tend to be centered on strict adherence to Wahhibism, which is an extremely strict form
        of Sunni Islam that sees many other forms of Islam as idolatrous. The group has denounced the members of the Sufi and the Shiite sects as infidels.Boko Haram seeks the establishment of an Islamic state in Nigeria. It opposes the Westernization
        of Nigerian society and the concentration of the wealth of the country among members of a small political elite, mainly in the Christian south of the country
